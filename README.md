# CATHe

CATHe (short for CATH embeddings) is a deep learning tool designed to detect remote homologues (up to 20% sequence similarity) for superfamilies in the CATH database. CATHe consists of an artificial neural network model which was trained on sequence embeddings from the ProtT5 protein Language Model (pLM). It was able to achieve an accuracy of 85.6% +- 0.4%, and outperform the other baseline models derived from both, simple machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, and homology-based inference using BLAST. 

The dataset used for training, optimizing, and testing CATHe was derived from the CATH database. It can be downloaded from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1riUfeNMXghokq2Vy_T7j6IXSNxye7CvY?usp=sharing).
